# Component Compendium

A curated library for collecting and rendering beautiful frontend UI components with their code variants - saved per user, organised by implementation type, and previewed live directly from code.


## Vision

Component Compendium helps developers and designers:

-   Save UI components they love the look of
-   Store multiple code implementations (React + Tailwind, React + CSS, HTML + CSS, etc)
-   Preview them live from code (no screenshots)
-   Organise personal collections with tags and remixable style options in the future

It’s a visual inspiration board mixed with a practical code vault, built to make UI collection _actually useful_ for real development.

## Upcoming MVP Features

-   User authentication via **Supabase Auth**
-   Personal UI component collections tied to user accounts
-   Multi-variant code storage per component
-   Implementation type support:
    -   `react-tailwind`
    -   `react-css`
    -   `html-css`
-   Code-based live preview (iframe or Sandpack integration)
-   Tag-based organisation
-   Copy-to-clipboard for code snippets
-   Secure user isolation using **Row Level Security (RLS)**

## AI in this Project
AI was only used in the making of this ReadMe. I have turned off my AI autocomplete in my editor for this project (to help drill the basics into my brain)
Just look through the code if you don't believe me.
I have terrible spelling, weird variable/component names, and a unique coding style definitely befiting of a junior developer.
I am doing projects like these to improve my skills and build something I (and hopefully others) will find useful.
